# Individual Reflections

## Thomas Nohrin

**Strengths and weaknesses**
I consider myself quite flexible when working in a group.
By that I mean I can adapt to different ways of working and by doing that let others work in their prefered way.
I also find myself taking the initiative in discussions in order to get the conversation started.
I do my best to keep a positive mindset but more importantly to also be realistic as I believe that to be crucial for a projects success.

I often doubt my judgement in comparison to others which leads to me leaning a bit on others in group projects.
Because of that I tend to not questions others decisions/opinions even if I have a different suggestion worth mentioning.
As previously mentioned I have a tendency to procrastinate (delay working until the last second) which really just causes unnecessary stress and might also slow down and impact others if their work depends on mine being done.
This is something I should really work on as it's a relatively easy change to make while the benefits (both in groups and not), such as the reduced stress and better planning to name a few, are well worth it.

**What motivates/demotivates me in group projects**
When working in a group project I find myself being very motivated by seeing progress being made and when I see others taking initiative and being enthusiastic about the project.
What demotivates me is when I've been stuck on a certain problem, maybe for hours, and it starts to feel impossible.
This is especially true if it's close to the start of the project/assignment.
Personally I prefer to work in a smaller group of two-three people.
I think it's great to have someone to discuss ideas with and who can help you when you're stuck but when the group grows too large it's rare that everyone is motivated and want the same things.

**Timelog**
Loging time has gone surprisingly well.
I have written a log (in swedish) with somewhat accurate time spent and a short text describing what I worked on.

## Emmeli Blomkvist

As a team member I would like to think that I am good at listening to the other group members and at taking responsibility for the work that I am assigned to do. I also think I am quite flexible when it comes to way of working; I both like working independently and working together with other group members on tasks. As for weaknesses, I am not the best at taking initiatives and expressing my opinions in group settings. Especially when I feel like I don't understand a task or a problem as well as other team members, I tend to step back instead of asking questions and trying to understand the matter better.

This way of withdrawing is something that I really want to work away, so I will definitely try to get better at asking other team members for help in these situations, and I also want to challenge myself a bit more by taking on more difficult tasks; during the project I mostly took on tasks that I felt certain that I could complete on my own, not challenging myself as much as I could have done. Onwards I would also like to be better at contributing to the positivity and good moods in the group.

To me, it is important to have a optimistic atmosphere in the team when working on a project like this. The project being stimulating and giving me an opportunity to learn new things is also important for my motivation, as well as the feeling that progress is being made. I find that dividing an assignment into small tasks before starting to work on it, like we did for this project, helps a lot with maintaining that feeling of progress. While it hasn't been very hard to estimate the time for basic tasks, working on implementation and bugs has sometimes taken much more time than anticipated, which could be frustrating. Logging the time spent went without problems.

I have learnt a lot about working in a larger team during the project; in earlier courses we have often worked in pairs or groups of three, which I think is what works best for me since I really appreciate being able to discuss problems with others but also have trouble feeling comfortable in large groups. I would name my way of staying in the background a bit too much as my biggest fail; the biggest win would be learning much about project work, especially organising the work of a larger team and working with issues, branches and pull requests on GitHub.

## Mauritz Sverredal
I would say my strengths when working in a team are: responding to messages quickly and helping others when they have a problem, and coming up with ideas for how to solve different problems. My weaknesses IMO are: I can be bad at communicating my ideas/plans (either because I'm unsure how to verbalize my plans or because I don't want to be overbearing and dictate too much) which can lead to extra work for other people if they could have benefitted from that input before starting a task. I can also have a hard time sticking to just one task which can make it difficult to maintain a good division of labour.

I think one of the major points of improvement for me is being more proactive with my communication and being better at communicating plans and ideas. Another related area of improvement is getting better at cooperating on task, more specifically splitting up tasks in a way that allows for efficient collaboration.

I am motivated by a project that is fun, challenging enough but not too challenging, and that feels like it could be genuinely useful. It is also motivating to work in a well-functioning group. I get demotivated if my coworkers don't seem like they are taking the project seriously (not a problem during this project) or if I don't find the project interesting.

I am not that good at estimating how long tasks will take and I often underestimate the time taken up by debugging.

I'd say I can fill any role in a team depending on what is needed but I don't enjoy writing (reports etc.) so I usually avoid those tasks if possible. Regarding working in a team vs. working alone I prefer working alone as I feel I can put 100% of my effort into understanding and solving the problem as it reduces the amount of time spent on meetings, code review etc. Working in a team can be good sometimes, but I feel like it is only helpful on a project bigger than this one (in terms of code required)

I don't think I've learned that much during this project as it doesn't feel more complex than inlupp 2 and I had experience with the tools we used.

It has been quite tricky to log time as it's sometimes hard for me how to count the time used for example if I'm just thinking about the project but not actually sitting at my computer working on it, or if I'm not that concentrated on the work/take a lot of breaks to do other things.

I would say my biggest win during this project was setting up makefiles and CI early so we could ensure all merged code was working properly (this caught quite a few errors). My biggest fail was probably not writing enough tests and not working enough around new years causing a crunch before the deadline. (the lack of tests meant I/we didn't know the code wasn't working properly giving a false sense of security)

## Emil Edin

I would say I generally function quite alright in a team. And mostly I would say my strengths being that I am quite flexible when it comes to working or finding time for a meeting. Another strength I would say is that I am quite agreeable, which for team dynamic is a strength. However, it could also be one of my weaknesses as I don't always confront or speak up and more go with what the rest of the group thinks. Another weakness is that I also procrastinate quite easily which is not only bad for myself but also may impact my teammates if they depend on the work I'm procrastinating on. The way I would adapt myself to work better in a team would be to limit my weaknesses. Which would be the aspect of procrastinating but also be more confident and discuss more if there is something I would think differently than other group members.

The thing that motivates me would be the thrill of working on the task at hand. But also when you are making progress on your task but also on the project and when you combine the different parts of a project that different teammates have worked on and see that it all works. The other side which is demotivating is when progress is slow or when you don't notice errors that you later figure out. To stay motivated is to keep reminding yourself that the path to the finish line, meaning finishing the project is not linear and that eventually even though there are setbacks you will be able to finish the project.

Another weakness that I have is that I am bad at estimating how long a task will take. For me, it is very hard because a task may seem simple, but most often than not it takes much more time than you anticipated. I most often just think it will not take a lot of time and my thought process is often that, and I often forget about other variables to a task that makes me underestimate most of the time.

The role that I want to play in a team is to be balanced on taking space but making sure everybody is included and taking part. I would say I fall in two different patterns, either if not a lot of people take initiative a lot of the time I would myself do it. However, if there are people who do that I would take a less initiative role in the group.

I would say I get a lot out of working in a group and especially when it comes to programming since it is easy when you are working alone to be stuck in a thinking pattern. And working together you exchange ideas. I would say I have learned a lot of stuff during the project and I learn best by doing. However, I find that this project is not really much different to the other parts of the course since the four assignments themselves require you to learn by doing. But I would agree that this project is more independent.

Loging time has gone okay, although I have not always written down what I've worked on.
I have written a log with somewhat accurate time spent.

## Karl Widborg Kortelainen

Historically, I've had great difficulities working in groups. This is usually because some people decide not to be as active as others and makes a bigger project usually difficult to complete since it's usually not created for only a couple of people in a group to complete. This has usually resulting in me taking a leadership role in a group and me taking the "shots". This time I have not found the need to take this role as others have stepped forwards and also taken initiative. Therefore I have found this group project being a lot of fun and enjoyable as it seems as other people in my group has been equally as interested in completing the project as me.

Following this a natural strength I usually see that I have in group projects is speaking my mind and saying what I think about a solution. I usually have a hard time letting go of my own ideas when other people do not agree. This have punished me in the past. I have tried to learn from those past experiences and really try to listen to others in the group and **trusting** their opinion on a specific topic. This time I think I have succeeded and it has increased my contribution to the group since I haven't created "garbage" code that ends up being thrown away. Instead the code I have produced have ended up in the code base.

Working with a group is great but rather difficult. Working alone is a lot simpler. It's great to work in a group since you can produce a lot more together but it also means that you have to discuss solutions and come up with a plan together so that different parts that each person builds ends up working together. While this is a difficult task, it leads into great success when it ends up working.

While I prefer working in smaller groups, I have in this project seen how much more is possible to do in a larger group. I think we could have done more in our time span, but a lot of the time went to getting used to the new way of working. We used a tickets system for every issue that we faced. It also took a lot of time to actually plan each sprint. If we would have been more used to the way of working it might have been possible to complete some more optimizations in our program. But since we truly tried and enforce the new way of working it has also lead into a great, robust & failsafe program. Our working process has all in all created great code!

## Alicia Sjöstrand

My biggest strength in a group setting, or a project I would say is that I don’t really have an ego, if I want to do something one way and then someone else gives a better suggestion on how to solve the problem, I am more than happy to choose their approach, and in the process learn something. I don’t think this has really mattered that much in this project though, as I have felt that everyone has had that approach going into the project. I think that has been really great as I feel like everyone’s opinion matter as much, and that no one has been afraid to voice their opinion in fear of being turned downed because of someone’s ego.

My biggest weakness in my opinion is that I am not so keen on taking a prominent role in the project, as I feel the others knows more, and therefore it’s better if I just assist them in what every way they need. This has resulted in that I mostly did the very basic tasks, that was very easy but had to be done, as I felt more comfortable in doing does tasks rather than the more advanced ones. This led to the fact that I did not really learn very much from a programming point of view, but I don’t think that was the most important part of the project anyways.

What I really found very exciting about this project is that it really felt more “real” than all the other project we have done during the years. It was really fun to work in sprints, and to actually plan very thoroughly and actually following our schedule. I also found it very useful to actually learn Github, which is something I haven’t used to its full potential before, but now I have learned using pull requests and issues in an efficient way.

My time logging has gone ok, I forgot to log some of the time when I just did some minor stuff, but that time adds up in the end, so I could have been a bit better at it.
