# Code Quality Report
During this project we have used the Apache C as our coding convention. This ensured that the code that we as a team wrote was consistent throughout and ensured good code quality based upon the coding standard that we chose. We believe we have written high quality code, which is based on several aspects. Readability is one of them, and we have besides following Apache C made sure to provide comments in areas to explain the function of code that is not clear from the code itself. Furthermore, we have made sure to use good naming conventions and this is applied throughout the program to make maintainable code. It is also important to make sure the code that is written is easy to follow and not too difficult to comprehend. For example, we have made sure that when writing functions they should be structured in a way that makes the logic easy to follow and break up similar logic which makes the code more modularized.

Performance and correctness are also important aspects of high quality code. From our point of view we think we have had good measures to insure this. For example, we have used continuous integration to make sure workflow is smooth and makes sure correctness is applied. We have also made sure to test a lot when writing our functions to make sure our code functions correctly. We have also made sure it is performant and been rigorous on making sure our code is efficient where it is critical. We have also used tools to check that our tests cover the code that we have implemented.

Code reviewing has also been significant in making sure our code is of a high standard. The general rule that we set for us was that before we could merge our changes, we had to get approval from two reviewers. The consequences for writing quality code for us was that it took more time to complete tasks. Since we all think differently and have different ways and styles of writing code. To make sure we have good code, our goal was to limit the subjective aspect of writing code, excluding the Apache C since that was a given that we followed.
